# Python-Simple-Management-Project
This is one of my python projects throughout my learning journey using OOP. The project is based on a simple Hospital Management system on the basis of CRUD


 # Royal Hospital Management System

This is a Python program that implements a simple hospital management system. The program allows the user to add, view, update, and delete patient records.

## Usage

The program presents the user with a menu of options. The user can choose to add a new patient, view existing records, update records, delete an existing record, or exit the program.

To add a new patient, the user must enter the patient's ID, name, age, gender, address, and health condition. The program will then add the patient to the database.

To view existing records, the user can select the "View existing records" option. The program will then display a list of all the patients in the database.

To update a record, the user must enter the patient's ID. The program will then display the patient's information and allow the user to edit it.

To delete a record, the user must enter the patient's ID. The program will then delete the patient from the database.


The program is divided into the following classes:

* `Patient`: This class represents a patient. It has the following attributes:

    * `ID`: The patient's ID.
    * `name`: The patient's name.
    * `age`: The patient's age.
    * `gender`: The patient's gender.
    * `address`: The patient's address.
